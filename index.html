                            <li>
                                He was born as Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam on 15 October 1931 into a Muslim
                                family
                                in Rameswaram, then in the Madras Presidency in British India, and now in the state of
                                Tamil
                                Nadu. His father Jainulabudeen was a boat owner while his mother Ashiamma was a
                                housewife.
                                Kalam had four elder siblings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Even though his ancestors had been wealthy traders, the family had lost most of its
                                fortunes
                                by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had
                                to
                                sell newspapers in order to add to the family’s meager income.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Even though the family was not financially well-off, the children were raised in an
                                atmosphere filled with love. In one of the books which Kalam wrote decades later, he
                                fondly
                                remembered how his mother would lovingly feed her own quota of food to the children and
                                go
                                hungry herself.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                He was a good student and always curious to learn more about how things happened. When
                                he
                                was ten years old, one of his teachers, Siva Subramania Iyer, took the students to the
                                seashore and asked them to observe the birds in flight.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then the teacher gave the children a theoretical explanation, which coupled with the
                                live
                                practical example, cast a deep influence on young Kalam’s mind. That very day the boy
                                realized that his life’s calling had something to do with flight.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After completing his studies at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, he enrolled at Saint
                                Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, graduating in science in 1954. Pursuing his childhood
                                dream, he travelled to Madras to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
                                Technology.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                During his third year, he was assigned a project to design a low-level attack aircraft
                                together with a few other students. The project was a difficult one and on top of it,
                                their
                                guide gave them a very tight deadline. The young men toiled together, working under
                                immense
                                pressure, and finally managed to achieve the target within the stipulated deadline. The
                                guide was thoroughly impressed by Kalam’s dedication.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                At this juncture, Kalam aspired to become a fighter pilot. However he could not realize
                                this
                                dream.

                                A.P.J. Abdul Kalam earned his degree from Madras Institute of Technology in 1957 and
                                joined
                                the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development
                                Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist in 1958.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the early 1960s, he worked with the Indian National Committee for Space Research
                                (INCOSPAR) under the renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai. He also designed a small
                                hovercraft at DRDO.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                He visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight
                                Center
                                in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility in 1963-64. Inspired by this visit,
                                he
                                began working on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.

                            <li>
                                However, he was not much satisfied with his work at DRDO and was happy to be transferred
                                to
                                the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. There he served as the project
                                director of the SLV-III, India’s first indigenously designed and produced satellite
                                launch
                                vehicle.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the 1970s, he began making efforts to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                                (PSLV).
                                Developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into
                                Sun-synchronous orbits, the nation’s PSLV project was an eventual success; it was first
                                launched on 20 September 1993.

                            <li>
                                A.P.J. Kalam also directed several other projects, including Project Devil, in the
                                1970s.
                                Project Devil was an early liquid-fueled missile project aimed at producing a
                                short-range
                                surface-to-air missile. The project was not a success in the long-term and was
                                discontinued
                                in the 1980s. However it led to the later development of the Prithvi missile in the
                                1980s.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                He was also involved with the Project Valiant which aimed at the development of
                                intercontinental ballistic missile. Similar to Project Devil, this project too was not a
                                success in itself but played a role in the development of the Prithvi missile later on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the early 1980s, the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), an
                                Indian
                                Ministry of Defence programme managed by the DRDO in partnership with other government
                                organizations was launched. Kalam was asked to lead the project and thus he returned to
                                DRDO
                                as the Chief Executive of the IGMDP in 1983.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The IGMDP, under the able leadership of Kalam proved to be a resounding success and
                                produced
                                a number of successful missiles including the first Prithvi missile in 1988, and the
                                Agni
                                missile in 1989. Due to his achievements as the director of the IGMDP, A.P.J. Abdul
                                Kalam
                                earned the nickname of “Missile Man.”

                            <li>
                                His increasing involvement with governmental agencies led to his appointment as the
                                Scientific Adviser to the Defense Minister in 1992. In 1999, he was appointed as the
                                Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India with the rank of cabinet
                                minister.

                            <li>
                                In the late 1990s, he played a major role in conducting the Pokhran-II, a series of five
                                nuclear bomb test explosions at the Indian Army's Pokhran Test Range in May 1998.
                                Following
                                the success of these tests which elevated Kalam to the status of a national hero, the
                                then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared India a full-fledged nuclear state.

                            <li>
                                In addition to being a brilliant scientist, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was also a visionary. In
                                1998, he proposed a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020 to serve as an action
                                plan to make India a developed nation by the year 2020. He put forward several
                                suggestions,
                                including nuclear empowerment, technological innovations, and improved agricultural
                                productivity to achieve the same.

                            <li>
                                In 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
                                expressed
                                its decision to nominate A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for the President of India to succeed
                                outgoing
                                President K.R. Narayanan. Both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party
                                backed
                                his candidacy. Kalam, being a popular national figure, easily won the presidential
